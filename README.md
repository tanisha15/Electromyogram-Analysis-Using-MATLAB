# Electromyogram-Analysis-Using-MATLAB
EMG signal analysis is used for the detection of any disorder in the skeletal muscles. In this project, we pass the EMG signals of 3 patients, healthy patient, myopathic patient and neuropathic patient and observe the change in the signals produced for identifying the type of disorder.
