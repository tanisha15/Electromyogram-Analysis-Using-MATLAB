# Electromyogram Analysis Using MATLAB
EMG signal analysis is used for the detection of any disorder in the skeletal muscles. In this project, we pass the EMG signals of 3 patients, healthy patient, myopathic patient and neuropathic patient and observe the change in the signals produced for identifying the type of disorder.

## Code
1. Load the data sets of the 3 patients provided in the `txt` file.
2. As the EMG signal has high frequency sampling is done at high sampling rates.
3. The samples are normalized to a meaningful amplitude within a certain range.
4. FFT is performed to analyze the signal in the frequency domain.
5. Myopathic patients and neuropathic patients have shorter duration, high amplitude spikes and increased polyphasicity.
6. The difference can be observed in the `OUTPUT` document provided.

## Pre-Requisites
* MATLAB R2020
* load the datasets provided for each patient.
*  `DSP TOOLBOX` installed.
